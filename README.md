# Data-Engineering
This is a Data Engineering project, which is part of the Data Science &amp; Analytics post-graduation at PUC-RJ. The aim of the project is to build a data pipeline using cloud technology. I've combined Databricks with Google Colab. The data pipeline will focus on ETL, involving data search, collection, modeling, loading and analysis.
